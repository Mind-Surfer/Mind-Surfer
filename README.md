Hi, Iâ€™m @Mind-Surfer I'm a Solution Architect by profession and I am thoroughly enjoying using/learning Azure and the DevOps tool sets. 

I've been here for a while but not actively engaged in the community and I've recently decided to change that. Ive started to publish some of my own work for 
others to use and/or collaborate on. 

I hope that you find my work useful and if you do have any suggestions, you can reach me at github.mindsurfer@outlook.com.
